# band-name-generator
A simple python program that generates a name for a band using the formula of putting a random adjective (or sometimes no adjective) in front of any animal name, since they all seem to do that.

### Bands that (possibly) used this generator:
- Glass Animals
- Arctic Monkeys
- Tame Impala
- Def Leppard (close enough)
- The Beatles (duh)
- The Animals (this one's creative)
- And many more...
